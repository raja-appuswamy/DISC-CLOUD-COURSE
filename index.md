# Course Description
The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive view on recent topics and trends in distributed systems and cloud computing. We will discuss the software techniques employed to construct and program reliable, highly-scalable systems. We will also cover architecture design of modern datacenters and virtualization techniques that constitute a central topic of the cloud computing paradigm. The course is complemented by a number of lab sessions to get hands-on experience with Hadoop and the design of scalable algorithms with MapReduce.

## Prerequisites
Knowledge of data structures, algorithm design, distributed algorithms. Being fluent with Java and at least another programming language (python is recommended, scala is required for advanced topics) is highly desirable.
